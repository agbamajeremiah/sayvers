                                assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and
                                representatives. In addition, "we" and "us" include any third party providing any product, service,

                                We and you shall use all reasonable endeavours to resolve amicably and in good faith any
                                dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. In the event that we and you are
                                unable to reach a resolution, we and you shall mutually agree on the appointment of a sole
                                arbitrator within fourteen (14) Business Days from when the dispute arises as well as the
                                location of the arbitration. We and you agree that the decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and
                                binding on both of us. <br>
                                Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in
                                court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to
                                submit to the jurisdiction of the court for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not
                                be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. <br>

                                we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. <br>
